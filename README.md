--Instructions for Use--

Run 'open index.html' from your terminal.

Press 'Show New Random Cover' to generate a new random cover.

Click 'Save Cover' to add any cover to the Saved Covers Section.

Click 'View Saved Covers' to access the Saved Covers Sections.

Click 'Make Your Own Cover' to make your own cover. Add a link to a .jpg file in the first field, and text in the subsequent fields. For proper syntax, only add one word to "First Descriptor" and "Second Descriptor".

Click 'Make my book' to see your new cover!

----Additional Notes--------

Removed "View Cover" button from the "View Saved Covers" page, as it seemed redundant.

None of the features will persist on page load, as we haven't learned how to make that happen yet.
